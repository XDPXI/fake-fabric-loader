**NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH FABRICMC.**

## Description

This mod provides a fake Fabric Loader to satisfy mods that require a specific Fabric Loader version you don’t want to use (or can't).

## Example (my use case)

RRLS requires the latest version of Fabric Loader. If you’re using Quilt, updates to Fabric Loader are often delayed, and sometimes never arrive. This is where this mod helps; it pretends that the required Fabric Loader version is present, allowing RRLS to run without issues.

## Choosing a version

Each release corresponds to a specific Fabric Loader version. All versions are functionally identical; only the reported version number differs.
